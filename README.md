# assemblyscript-lang README

This is a quick and dirty AssemblyScript language plugin. It uses a modified verions of the Microsoft TypeScript grammar. There may be some TypeScript features that are unsupported in AssemblyScript that still remain in the grammar. There could aslo be some AssemblyScript grammar still missing. If you see something please conatct me (Rick Battagline) on Twitter: @battagline

## Features

I'm attempting to suppor the entire grammar of AssemblyScript (see assemblyscript.org). This plugin is rather quick and dirty and I plan on improving it over time.

## Known Issues

This is a work in progress. Please contact me if you see some of the AssemblyScript grammar that is missing, or if there is some of the TypeScript grammar that is unsupported in AssemblyScript. I chose the extension .asc for the AssemblyScript files. I did this rather arbitrarily so a different extension may be used in the future.
